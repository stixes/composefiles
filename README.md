# Docker-compose services

## Service

A service is a folder, in which a docker-compose.yml file defines the service,
with any persisted state available in nearby folders. 

Each service is designed to use a `.env` file with custom environment configuration,
such as passwords, which of course has been redacted.

Included in this repo is composefiles, as used in multiyear deployments, rebuilt to
have a ready-to-start setup

See individual folders for further descriptions.
